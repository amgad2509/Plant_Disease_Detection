# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview

This project is dedicated to the detection of plant diseases using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on achieving a high accuracy rate of 98%. The model accurately identifies various plant diseases from images, aiding in the timely diagnosis and treatment of affected plants.

## Objective

The primary objective of Plant Disease Detection is to provide an effective tool for farmers and agricultural professionals to identify and manage plant diseases. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model assists in early disease detection, thereby reducing crop losses and improving agricultural productivity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises a comprehensive collection of images depicting various plant diseases and healthy plant samples. Each image is labeled with the corresponding plant disease or health status, enabling supervised learning for disease classification.

## Model Performance

The machine learning model deployed in this project achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 98% on the test dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robustness and reliability in disease detection.

## Disease Classes

The model can accurately classify images into the following plant disease classes:
